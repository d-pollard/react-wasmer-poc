# React WASMER Gif -> MP4 Proof of Concept

## Install & Run
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Description
I kept this super simple, everything you need is in the `App.tsx` file.

I've included my sample GIF located at `./input.gif`

## Progress
- Got something minimal, but I don't think I have the correct incantation needed for FFMPEG to generate an MP4 file from the provided GIF
